# Project Purpose

This project, "dotfiles", is designed to manage and automate the setup of a personalized development environment. It primarily focuses on:
- **Configuration Management**: Storing and symlinking various configuration files (dotfiles) for tools like Zsh, Neovim, Alacritty, and tmux.
- **Package Management**: Automating the installation and updating of software packages using Homebrew (for macOS), npm (for Node.js packages), and Go modules.
- **Environment Setup**: Providing scripts and a Makefile to streamline the initial setup and ongoing maintenance of the development environment.
- **Version Control**: Utilizing Git for tracking changes to the dotfiles and GitHub for continuous integration (via GitHub Actions).
